            "question": "Angular momentum is quantized as an integer multiple of the reduced form of this quantity, which is equal to this quantity over two pi and is denoted with a bar. The de Broglie [\"de broy\"] wavelength is equal to this quantity over momentum. The product of the standard deviations of position and momentum is at least this quantity over four pi by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and the energy of a photon is equal to this constant times the speed of light over wavelength. Give this constant, denoted lowercase h, named for a German founder of quantum theory.",
