Science,"Launched into low Earth orbit in 1990, this space-based observatory has become one of the most important instruments in the history of astronomy. It was not the first space telescope, but it is one of the largest and most versatile, known for its deep field images that have provided a deeper look into space and time. This telescope is named after an American astronomer who is famous for his discovery of the universe's expansion. What is the name of this telescope that has allowed astronomers to observe the most distant stars and galaxies ever seen",Hubble Space Telescope,FALSE
Science,"First isolated using simple adhesive tape, this material was discovered at the University of Manchester by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, who were later awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010 for their work. It is notable for being just one atom thick, making it one of the thinnest yet strongest materials ever tested.What is this two-dimensional material composed of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice?",Graphene,FALSE
Science,"This American virologist was born in New York City in 1914. After focusing on influenza research, he shifted his attention to a viral disease that caused widespread fear and paralysis, particularly affecting children. In a significant act of public service, he chose not to patent his greatest medical discovery, famously stating, ""Could you patent the sun?"" His research led to the first effective vaccine against polio, introduced in 1955. What is the name of this influential medical researcher?",Jonas Salk,FALSE
Science,"Initially derived from the pancreases of dogs and later from cattle and pigs, this hormone plays a critical role in part of the body's metabolic regulation. Its first use in treating a human patient was in 1922. This medical advancement earned the discovering scientist the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1923. Today, it is synthesized using recombinant DNA technology, providing essential treatment for diabetes patients worldwide. What is this life-saving hormone called?",Insulin,FALSE
Science,"Formulated in 1925, this equation is a key foundation of quantum mechanics and provides a mathematical description of the wave-like behavior of particles at atomic and subatomic scales. Unlike classical mechanics, it uses a wave function to describe probabilistically the state of a particle rather than determining precise outcomes. Developed by an Austrian physicist who later won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933 for his contributions to the wave theory of matter, this equation has revolutionized our understanding of the atomic world. What is the name of this critical equation in quantum physics?",Schrodinger's Equation,FALSE
