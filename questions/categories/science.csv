Science,"Launched into low Earth orbit in 1990, this space-based observatory has become one of the most important instruments in the history of astronomy. It was not the first space telescope, but it is one of the largest and most versatile, known for its deep field images that have provided a deeper look into space and time. This telescope is named after an American astronomer who is famous for his discovery of the universe's expansion. What is the name of this telescope that has allowed astronomers to observe the most distant stars and galaxies ever seen",Hubble Space Telescope,TRUE
Science,"First isolated using simple adhesive tape, this material was discovered at the University of Manchester by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, who were later awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010 for their work. It is notable for being just one atom thick, making it one of the thinnest yet strongest materials ever tested.What is this two-dimensional material composed of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice?",Graphene,TRUE
Science,"This American virologist was born in New York City in 1914. After focusing on influenza research, he shifted his attention to a viral disease that caused widespread fear and paralysis, particularly affecting children. In a significant act of public service, he chose not to patent his greatest medical discovery, famously stating, ""Could you patent the sun?"" His research led to the first effective vaccine against polio, introduced in 1955. What is the name of this influential medical researcher?",Jonas Salk,TRUE
Science,"Initially derived from the pancreases of dogs and later from cattle and pigs, this hormone plays a critical role in part of the body's metabolic regulation. Its first use in treating a human patient was in 1922. This medical advancement earned the discovering scientist the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1923. Today, it is synthesized using recombinant DNA technology, providing essential treatment for diabetes patients worldwide. What is this life-saving hormone called?",Insulin,TRUE
Science,"Formulated in 1925, this equation is a key foundation of quantum mechanics and provides a mathematical description of the wave-like behavior of particles at atomic and subatomic scales. Unlike classical mechanics, it uses a wave function to describe probabilistically the state of a particle rather than determining precise outcomes. Developed by an Austrian physicist who later won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933 for his contributions to the wave theory of matter, this equation has revolutionized our understanding of the atomic world. What is the name of this critical equation in quantum physics?",Schrodinger's Equation,TRUE
Science,"This scientist was born in 1822 in a region now part of the Czech Republic and initially entered a monastery where he could receive an education. He conducted hybridization experiments in the monastery's garden, using pea plants to study inheritance patterns. His work laid the foundation for the modern understanding of genetics, though it was largely ignored during his lifetime. What is the name of this pioneer of genetic research, known for his laws of inheritance?",Gregor Mendel,FALSE
Science,"Developed in the early 21st century, this groundbreaking biotechnological tool allows for precise editing of the DNA in the genomes of living organisms. It utilizes a component of a bacterial immune system, which captures pieces of DNA from viruses, to make precise cuts in specific DNA sequences. This innovation has transformed genetic research, offering potential treatments for a myriad of genetic diseases and advancements in agricultural science. What is the name of this powerful gene-editing technology?","CRISPR, CRISPR-Cas9",FALSE
Science,"Invented by Nikola Tesla in the late 19th century, this electrical resonant transformer circuit is used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high-frequency alternating-current electricity. Notable for creating impressive electrical arcs and being used in entertainment and educational displays, it was originally developed as part of Tesla's experiments with wireless lighting and electrical power distribution. What is the name of this device that exemplifies Teslaâ€™s work in electrical engineering?","Tesla Coil, coil",FALSE
Science,"Developed by a French mathematician in the early 19th century, this mathematical transform is essential for analyzing the frequencies contained in a signal. It decomposes a function or a dataset into a spectrum of its sine and cosine components, enabling engineers and scientists to work with the frequency domain rather than time domain. This technique has wide-ranging applications, including image processing, signal analysis, and quantum physics. What is the name of this transformative analysis method, named after its inventor?",Fourier Transform,FALSE
