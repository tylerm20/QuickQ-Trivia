        "question": "A plane created by the company Boom reached this speed. The plane, XB-1, is the first privately developed aircraft to reach this speed. This speed, which is faster than the speed of sound, is measured in Mach numbers, with Mach 1 representing the speed of sound at a given altitude and temperature. The Concorde, a passenger jet that operated from 1976 to 2003, could travel at Mach 2, crossing the Atlantic Ocean in under 3.5 hours.  Chuck Yeager, an American test pilot, became the first person to break the sound barrier in level flight in 1947, flying the experimental Bell X-1 aircraft.  What is this speed, which creates a sonic boom when an object travels through the air faster than sound waves can propagate?",

        "question": "Microsoft recently announced a breakthrough in this field with the announcement of their Majorana 1 chip. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as 0s or 1s, the field uses qubits, which can represent 0, 1, or both simultaneously. This phenomenon, known as superposition, allows these computers to perform calculations exponentially faster than classical computers for certain types of problems.
